# Images Directory

This folder contains all images used by the Spartan AI website.

## Current Images

Currently, all images are embedded as SVG icons directly in the HTML files. If you need to add image files (PNG, JPG, SVG, etc.), place them in this directory.

## Usage

Reference images in HTML like this:
```html
<img src="img/your-image.png" alt="Description">
```

Or in CSS:
```css
background-image: url('img/your-image.png');
```
