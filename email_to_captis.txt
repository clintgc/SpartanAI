Subject: GET /scan/{id} endpoint not returning JSON payload - Authentication format question

Hi Captis Support Team,

We're experiencing an issue with the GET /scan/{id} endpoint not returning the expected JSON payload. We're getting 403 Forbidden errors when trying to poll for scan results.

**Current Request Format:**
We're trying to match the format that works for the `/scans` (list) endpoint:

Working example (list endpoint):
```
GET https://asi-api.solveacrime.com/pub/asi/v4/scans?accessKey={accessKey}&page=0&size=5
```

Our request (single scan endpoint):
```
GET https://asi-api.solveacrime.com/pub/asi/v4/scan/{scanId}?accessKey={accessKey}
```

**What's Happening:**
- The `/scans` endpoint works correctly with `accessKey` as a query parameter
- The `/scan/{scanId}` endpoint returns 403 Forbidden errors with the same format
- The POST /resolve endpoint works correctly with our access key
- We've verified our access key is valid (it works for POST and /scans GET requests)

**What we've tried:**
1. `accessKey` as query parameter: `GET /scan/{scanId}?accessKey={key}` → 403
2. `X-API-Key` header: `GET /scan/{scanId}` with `X-API-Key: {key}` header → 403

**Questions:**
1. What is the correct authentication format for the GET /scan/{id} endpoint?
2. Should we use X-API-Key header, query parameter, or both?
3. Are there any additional headers or parameters required for GET requests that differ from POST requests?

**Example Requests:**

Working (list endpoint):
```bash
curl -i -k -X GET "https://asi-api.solveacrime.com/pub/asi/v4/scans?accessKey=485989b1-7960-4932-bb91-cd15d406df33&page=0&size=5"
```

Not working (single scan endpoint):
```bash
curl -i -k -X GET "https://asi-api.solveacrime.com/pub/asi/v4/scan/{scanId}?accessKey=485989b1-7960-4932-bb91-cd15d406df33"
```

**Expected Response:**
We expect a JSON payload with scan results, similar to:
```json
{
  "id": "...",
  "status": "...",
  "matches": [...],
  ...
}
```

**Actual Response:**
We're receiving 403 Forbidden errors, preventing us from retrieving scan results.

Could you please clarify the correct authentication method for GET requests to the /scan/{id} endpoint? We want to ensure we're following your API specifications correctly.

Thank you for your assistance.
