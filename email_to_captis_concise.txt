Subject: GET /scan/{id} returning 403 Forbidden - Authentication format question

Hi Captis Support,

We're experiencing 403 Forbidden errors when calling the GET /scan/{id} endpoint to retrieve scan results. The POST /resolve endpoint works correctly with our access key, but GET requests are being rejected.

**Current Request:**
```
GET https://asi-api.solveacrime.com/pub/asi/v4/scan/{scanId}
Headers:
  X-API-Key: 485989b1-7960-4932-bb91-cd15d406df33
  Content-Type: application/json
```

**Response:** 403 Forbidden (no JSON payload returned)

**What we've tried:**
1. X-API-Key header (as shown above) → 403
2. accessKey as query parameter: `?accessKey={key}` → 403

**Questions:**
- What is the correct authentication format for GET /scan/{id}?
- Does it differ from POST /resolve (which works with X-API-Key header)?
- Are there additional required headers or parameters?

**Example curl command:**
```bash
curl -H "X-API-Key: 485989b1-7960-4932-bb91-cd15d406df33" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     "https://asi-api.solveacrime.com/pub/asi/v4/scan/{scanId}"
```

Could you please confirm the correct authentication method for GET requests? Our POST requests work fine, so we believe the access key is valid.

Thanks,
[Your Name]
